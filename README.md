# 🛡️ LLM Red Teaming & Adversarial Evaluation Suite

This repository contains a comprehensive corpus of Large Language Model (LLM) attack vectors and a Python test harness designed to evaluate model robustness. The suite covers a wide spectrum of techniques, ranging from basic prompt injection to advanced cryptographic, logical, and mathematical exploits (including GCG attacks).

## 📂 Repository Contents

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`01_attack_corpus_en.json`** | A JSON Lines dataset containing over **60 distinct attack vectors** (English), including persona modulation, logic locks, and obfuscation techniques. |
| **`02_attack_corpus_th.json`** | A JSON dataset containing **75 attack vectors adapted for Thai language context**, addressing cultural nuances and multilingual tokenization vulnerabilities. |
| **`03_red_team_runner.py`** | The main evaluation script for executing English attack vectors against target LLMs. |
| **`04_red_team_runner_thai.py`** | A specialized evaluation script handling Thai language nuances, encoding issues, and specific API behavior for non-Latin scripts. |
| **`05_indirect_red_team.py`** | A simulation script for **Indirect Prompt Injection** attacks (e.g., via poisoned emails, documents, or RAG contexts). |
| **`06_defense_runner.py`** | An implementation of the **"Sandwich Defense"** pattern to demonstrate mitigation strategies against the included attacks. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install openai
```

### Configuration

Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable to allow the runners to query the models:

**Mac/Linux:**

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'
```

## ⚔️ Usage

### 1\. Run Standard Red Teaming (English)

Execute the main runner to test the English corpus against your specified model:

```bash
python red_team_runner.py
```

### 2\. Run Multilingual Red Teaming (Thai)

Execute the specialized runner for Thai language attack vectors:

```bash
python red_team_runner_thai.py
```

### 3\. Analyze Results

After execution, the scripts will generate `.csv` files in the output directory. Open these files to view:

  * **Pass/Fail Assessments:** Did the model refuse the attack or comply?
  * **Response Logs:** The exact output generated by the model.
  * **Attack Category:** Which specific technique (e.g., GCG, Payload Splitting) caused the failure.
